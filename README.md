# boc_database
This is a simple database design inspired from my previous work experience in the Bank of China using imaginary data.
An ERD diagram is designed showing the relationships and structure of this database.
This database is implemented in PostgreSQL (code in BOC_AU.txt).
Sample queries are provided in another text file (AiXinxin_13064050_SQL.txt).
